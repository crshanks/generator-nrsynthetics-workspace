### Generate New Relic Synthetics workspace for development and testing of:
* Synthetics Scripted Browser
* Synthetics API test

## Requirementes
* [Node.js/NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (optional, for local repo)

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-nrsynthetics-workspace using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g @crshanks/generator-nrsynthetics-workspace
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash

yo @crshanks/nrsynthetics-workspace

```


## Generating a NR Synthetics workspace

1. Run `yo @crshanks/nrsynthetics-workspace` from commandline

2. Select `Yes` (default) when prompted `? Enable Download/Upload of Synthetics scripts to your account?`

3. Enter your Admin API Key when prompted, if you answered `Yes` from step-1.

```
This generator can also be run with: yo @crshanks/nrsynthetics-workspace

? Enable Download/Upload of Synthetics scripts to your account? Yes
? Enter your admin Api Key NRAA-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
? Initialize local Git repo? Yes

```
A workspace is created called `synthetics-local`, the admin key will be stored in `.nrconfig.json`.

Note: A local repo is setup for you, which would allow you to track and manage your local changes. To configure your local Git repo see [Customizing Git Configuration](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration).

## Download / Upload & Manage monitor
**Note:**  This option is only avaiabable if you opted  `Yes`  to **Enable Download/Upload of Synthetics scripts.**


1. Change directory into `synthetics-local` .
2. Download monitor by running this command: `npm run download`; to upload `npm run upload`. You can also run any of the following commands:
- To create a monitor: `npm run create`
- To delete a monitor: `npm run delete`
- To update a monitor's settings: `npm run update:settings`
3. You will be presented with a list for Scripted Browser and API test.
   You can select single or multiple monitors or select `ALL`.

```
> npm run download

Using apiKey: "XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
? Select Monitors (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)
❯ ◯ ALL
   = Scripted Browsers =
  ◯ scriptedBrowser-test1
  ◯ scriptedBrowser-test2
   = API Tests =
  ◯ apiTest-test1
  ◯ apiTest-test2

```
Files are downloaded to `./monitors` directory which also includes the Synthetics monitor configurations for your arccount, these are saved in `nr-monitor.json`.

**NOTE:**  Do not rename the monitor file name(s) or update the configuration file.


## Running  script locally

1. Add this to the top of your script, the library mimcs the Synthetics API and implements most common commands in Synthetics.

> It's important that `global._isApiTest` is set to `false`, for scripted browser tests.

```

    if (typeof $env === "undefined" || $env === null) {
      global._isApiTest = true;  // false, for Scripted Browser
      require("../lib/simulator");
    }
```
2. Execute the script by hitting *F5* from VScode or open a terminal, run `node <filename>.js` in the `./monitors`  directory.
```
monitors>  node <filename>.js
```

## Running Examples
### API Test
Open the file examples/apiTest.js and `F5` to execute.

Go to troubleshooting section if you received an error:
> Can't find Node.js binary "node": path does not exist. Make sure Node.js is installed and in your PATH, or set the "runtimeExecutable" in your launch.json

```
btan@local:~/synthetics-local$ node examples/apiTest.js
Response: { widgetCount: 10, widgetType: 'gear' }

```
### Scripted Browser
Open the file examples/apiTest.js and `F5` to execute.

Go to troubleshooting section if you received an error:
> Can't find Node.js binary "node": path does not exist. Make sure Node.js is installed and in your PATH, or set the "runtimeExecutable" in your launch.json

```
btan@local:~/synthetics-local$ node examples/scriptedBrowser.js

```
Browser opens

## Troubelshooting
### Error Message

#### TypeError: $browser.get is not a function. When running scripted browsers.
> Make sure that you've set:  `global._isApiTest = false`

#### Can't find Node.js binary "node": path does not exist. Make sure Node.js is installed and in your PATH, or set the "runtimeExecutable" in your launch.json

> Edit the file `.vscode/launch.json` , and add the "runtimeExecutable" property with the Node path:
```
      "runtimeExecutable": "<Node binary absolute path>",
```
Example:
```
  {
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
      "runtimeExecutable": "/Users/btan/.nvm/versions/node/v12.13.0/bin/node",
      "program": "${file}"
    }
  ]
}
```
